Thank you very much for purchasing this package.


- Note 1 -
Make sure to import Unity Post Processing Stack Package (recommend V2) into the project.
If you imported the Post Stack after this packaged been imported, you may find the 
PostProcessingProfile on the main camera "[Cam][Game]" in the demo scene is missing. 
In that case, you need to re-attach the profile to the camera. 

(1) For Post Processing Stack V2, the profile is located under Assets/[DreamingEarthling]/Elite Assault Droid/(Demo)/DemoPostProcessingProfileV2.asset
(2) For Post Processing Stack before version 2.0, the profile is located under Assets/[DreamingEarthling]/Elite Assault Droid/(Demo)/DemoPostProcessingProfileV1.asset

- Note 2 -
To re-create the same visual appearance shown in the promo video,
one needs to set the project to use linear color space in Player Settings.
